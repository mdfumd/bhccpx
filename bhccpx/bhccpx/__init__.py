#     The Complexity of Bank Holding Companies: A Topological Approach

#     Abstract:
#     We develop metrics to assess the complexity of a bank holding
#     company (BHC), based on its ownership structure. Large BHCs have
#     intricate ownership hierarchies involving hundreds or even thousands
#     of legal entities that may contribute to increased operational risk
#     and greater opacity. Our measures are mathematically grounded,
#     intuitive, and easy to implement. They may be particularly useful
#     in the context of resolution, where regulators often face significant
#     time pressure and coordination challenges. We use regulatory filing
#     data from the Federal Reserve to validate the measures, demonstrating
#     that they provide a useful complement to balance sheet information in
#     assessing BHC complexity. Notably, the proposed measures are highly
#     correlated with existing complexity indicators that are not based on
#     organizational structure and are less correlated with size than these
#     existing complexity measures. We show that the proposed measures
#     provide additional explanatory power for the regulatory indicators,
#     even after controlling for size.
