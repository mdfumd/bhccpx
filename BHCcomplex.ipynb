    "     _Large bank holding companies (BHCs) are structured into intricate ownership hierarchies involving hundreds or even thousands of legal entities. Each subsidiary in these hierarchies has its own legal form, assets, liabilities, managerial goals, and supervisory authorities. In the event of BHC default or insolvency, regulators may need to resolve the BHC and its constituent entities. Each entity individually will require some mix of cash infusion, outside purchase, consolidation with other subsidiaries, legal guarantees, and outright dissolution. The subsidiaries are not resolved in isolation, of course, but in the context of resolving the consolidated BHC at the top of the hierarchy. The number, diversity, and distribution of subsidiaries within the hierarchy can therefore significantly ease or complicate the resolution process. We propose a set of related metrics intended to assess the complexity of the BHC ownership graph. These proposed metrics focus on the graph quotient relative to certain well identified partitions on the set of subsidiaries, such as charter type and regulatory jurisdiction. The intended measures are mathematically grounded, intuitively sensible, and easy to implement. We illustrate the process with a case study of one large U.S. BHC._\n",

    "\n",
    " 1.   \\[**zip2xml**\\] Unpacking the _National Information Center_ (NIC) data to reveal the raw XML\n",
    " 1.   \\[**xml2csv**\\] Parsing the XML files to create CSV versions of the same data\n",
    " 1.   \\[**csv2sys**\\] Assembling a network (graph) representation of the banking system\n",
    " 1.   \\[**sys2bhc**\\] Extracting individual BHC subgraphs from the system\n",
    " 1.   \\[**bhc2out**\\] Calculating a range of complexity metrics on individual BHC graphs\n",
    " \n",
    "For example, the module **zip2xml.py** contains the code needed to unpack the NIC downloads (a set of \\*.zip files) into the underlying \\*.xml files. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence is encoded in the notebook cells below, with each cell invoking one of the Python modules indicated in square brackets above. You can execute the modules in any of several alternative modes:\n",
    "\n",
    " *   Through the steps (cells) in this notebook\n",
    " *   By invoking the modules from the command line\n",
    " *   By running the modules in an interactive Python shell\n",

    "## Execution sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 0 - Configuration\n",
    "You can control the execution process through a collection of configuration parameters. These parameters reside in the **bhc_complex.ini** configuration file, as key-value pairs. The availability of configuration parameters should discourage tinkering with the (tested) Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration file is divided into _sections_, indicated by labels in square brackets. For example, this snippet shows the beginning of the **[DEFAULT]** section in the configuration file:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ***\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# =============================================================================\n",
    "# ====== Default configuration parameters, for all modules ====================\n",
    "# =============================================================================\n",
    "[DEFAULT]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Default verbosity level\n",
    "verbose=True\n",
    "\n",
    "# Default high verbosity level\n",
    "veryverbose=False\n",
    "```\n",
    "   ***\n",
    "\n",
    "All parameter values in the **bhc_complex.ini** file are treated as strings. For simple (one-line) parameter settings, no quotes are required. For example, in the preceding snippet, the **verbose** parameter is assigned the string value, '_True_'. The Python program converts this string into the equivalent boolean value at runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and dictionaries in the **bhc_complex.ini** file are handled slightly differently. First, these parameter values are typically read from multiple consecutive lines in the configuration file. The closing brace indicating the end of the list or dictionary must be indented by at least one character (if the closing brace is not indented, it will be treated as the start of a new parameter key). The resulting string is evaluated as standard Python. So, string values _within_ lists and dictionaries should be enclosed in quotes. For example, in the following snippet, the **bhclist** parameter is a list of two integers (ID_RSSDs), while **asoflist** is a list of four strings (note the single quotes indicating string values). \n",
    "\n",
    "   ***\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# =============================================================================\n",
    "# ========= Configuration parameters for sys2bhc.py ===========================\n",
    "# =============================================================================\n",
    "[sys2bhc]\n",
    "\n",

    " ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "   ***\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also override the parameter values in the **bhc_complex.ini** file at runtime by modifying the configuration after you have read it from disk. The configuration indexes the parameters first by _section_ and then by _key_. For example, to tweak the **indir** directory location, you might submit the following code: \n",
    "\n",
    "   ***\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import bhc_datautil as UTIL\n",
    "CONFIG = UTIL.read_bhc_config()\n",
    "CONFIG['zip2xml']['indir']='../../data/2016redo'\n",
